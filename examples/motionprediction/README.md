# How to do motion prediction
- when no new image to detect new pose, do a motion prediction
- do a threex.motionpredictioncontrols
  - do that in /threex.motionpredictioncontrols.js
  - /examples/motionpredictioncontrols.html
  - move targetObject to the left 10 per seconds
  - display the controls.object which should move smoothly at 60fps
- this is a controls with 2 objects, both have the same parent
- controls.update() periodically, move the object toward the target
  - console.assert(this.object.parent === this.targetObject.parent)
  - at the begining do simply a copy of this.object/.targetObject
- .setPosition
